# vicausi: Visualizer of Causal Assumptions and Uncertainty-Aware Simulations of Interventions

This is a visualization tool that automatically transforms the outputs of the simulation pipeline of interventions found in <url>  into uncertainty-aware visualizations.
    
The classical **scatter plot matrix** is used for the visualization of the simulated probabilistic data before and after an intervention. 
    
This is enhanced with **interaction** or **animation** to present the simulated data of interventions in slices conditioned on the intervened variable.

In the **examples/insomnis.ipynb** notebook an example of use can be found.
    
The following videos demonstrate the three visualization modes offered by the tool for the presentation of the simulated data after the intervention.
